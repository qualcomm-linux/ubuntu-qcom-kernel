# sync-mirror.sh - Incrementally mirror new Canonical kernel upload tags into a
#                  branch of this repository while PRESERVING full upstream
#                  history.
#
# This is the steady-state "mirror-repoint" sync. It replaces the legacy
# shallow-clone + rsync + squash approach, which discarded all upstream history
# (one flattened snapshot commit per upload). Here, the branch becomes a faithful
# mirror of the upstream kernel tree: each upload is fetched with its real
# ancestry and frozen under an immutable per-upload tag.
#
# Mental model
# ────────────
#   * BRANCH  (e.g. resolute-qcom)            -- a MOVABLE "latest Canonical"
#                                                pointer; disposable by design.
#   * TAG     (e.g. Ubuntu-qcom-7.0.0-1006.8) -- the upstream Canonical tag,
#                                                mirrored VERBATIM. IMMUTABLE
#                                                per-upload record; the sole
#                                                anchor that preserves history.
#
# A sync is PURE FETCH + REPOINT -- it never merges or rebases, so it can never
# conflict and can never be blocked by developer patches layered on the branch.
# Developer patches are deliberately out of scope: the branch is force-advanced
# past them (they live on developers' own branches and are re-applied manually).
#
# Operational guardrails (each empirically validated by the history-preservation
# stress test; numbers refer to that test's findings):
#   G1  Pin the lease: --force-with-lease=<ref>:<old-sha>, never bare
#       --force-with-lease (a pre-push fetch silently defeats the bare form) and
#       never blind --force.
#   G2  Push the tag and the branch ATOMICALLY (--atomic) so they land together
#       or not at all -- prevents tag-lands/branch-rejected split-brain.
#   G3  Fail fast: abort the whole run on any rejected push. Never let the next
#       idempotent run mask an incomplete one.
#   G4  Tag every missing upload, ascending, and create the tag BEFORE moving the
#       branch. Latest-only silently drops unique commits from rebased uploads.
#   G5  Never use --depth on the incremental fetch -- the closure must be complete
#       and non-shallow.
#   G8  Operate on a BARE clone (no worktree) so the branch ref can be updated
#       without the "branch used by worktree" failure.
#   G10 Do not assume `git fetch` always exits 0 (a re-pointed upstream tag yields
#       a non-zero "would clobber existing tag" -- handled explicitly).
#
# Usage:
#   sync-mirror.sh
#
# Required environment:
#   MIRROR_URL       Authenticated push URL of THIS repo
#                    (e.g. https://x-access-token:TOKEN@github.com/org/repo.git)
#   UPSTREAM_URL     Canonical/Launchpad git URL to mirror from
#   BRANCH           Branch to advance (e.g. resolute-qcom)
#   UPSTREAM_PREFIX  Upstream tag prefix, mirrored verbatim (e.g. Ubuntu-qcom)
#
# Optional environment:
#   WORKDIR              Scratch directory for the bare mirror (default: mktemp)
#   MIN_HISTORY_COMMITS  Bootstrap sentinel: refuse to sync if BRANCH has fewer
#                        than this many commits, i.e. it has not been seeded with
#                        real history yet (default: 1000). Run bootstrap first.
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT        If set, the latest synced version is written as
#                        `synced_version=` and `synced_count=` for the caller.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  Up to date or one-or-more uploads synced successfully
#   1  Hard error (bootstrap required, push rejected, etc.)
